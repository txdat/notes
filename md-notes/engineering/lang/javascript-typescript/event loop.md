- JS is event-driven archtecture, use event-loop for asynchronous operations, handle multiple concurrent requests unblocking
- asynchronous programming is achieved by callbacks (triggered by an event)
- when an asynchronous operation is triggered, event loop puts callback to queue and continues running synchronous code until callstack is empty, then run callbacks in order
- event types
	- microtask:
		- higher priority task, run after current operation completes and before event loop moves to next phase
		- is associated to JS concurrency model
	- macrotask:
		- lower priority task, run after the current phase of event loop completes

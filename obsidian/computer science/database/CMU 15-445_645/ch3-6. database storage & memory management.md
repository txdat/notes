# chap 3+4: database storage
- DBMS assumes that primary storage location is non-volatile disk (disk), DBMS' components manage the movement of data between non-volatile (disk) and volatile storage (ram)
![[Pasted image 20240503001425.png | 600]]
- random access on non-volatile storage is much slower than sequential access -> DBMS want to maximize sequential access (data is stored in contiguous blocks)
- DBMS uses **mmap** (memory-mapped file - a syscall to map files/devices into memory [blog](https://eric-lo.gitbook.io/memory-mapped-io/shared-memory)) to store the contents of file into memory address space of program
### file storage
- DBMS stores database as one or more files (collections of pages) on disk in a proprietary format
- storage manager maintains database's files: tracks data read/written to pages, available space, ...
#### database page
- is a fixed-size block of data, given a unique id
- 3 types:
	- hardware page: usually 4KB (kilobytes), is largest block of data that storage manager can guarantee failsafe writes
	- OS page: 4KB, x64 2MB/1GB?
	- database page: 512B - 32KB
- DBMSs manage pages in files in different ways
	- heap file
		- is an unordered collection of pages, need metadata to track
		- DBMS maintains special pages that track the location of data pages in database files
		- page layout
			- header: contains page's metadata
			- 3 approaches for storing data in pages
				- tuple-oriented storage
					- keep track of the number of tuples in page and append new tuple to the end
					- slotted pages layout scheme: map slots to tuples' starting position offsets -> rearrange tuples' position offsets when deleting some tuples?
					- cons
						- fragmentation: unusable space, empty slots, ...
						- useless disk I/O: must fetch entire page to update
						- random disk I/O: have to update multiple tuples that each tuple is on a seperated page
				- log-structure storage #todo
					- tree in DBMS
					![[Pasted image 20240504012018.png | 600]]
				- index-organized storage #todo
					- DBMS stores a table's tuples as the value of index, use page layout like slotted page
		- tuple layout
			- is a sequence of bytes, with header and attributes data
			- denormalized tuple data
				- DBMS can denormalize related tuples and store them in the same page (reduce IO for common workload patterns, but can make updates more expensive)

	- sequential/sorted file
	- hashing file

# chap 5: storage models and compression
- workloads
	- online transaction processing (OLTP): read/update a small of data
	- online analytical processing (OLAP): complex queries that read a lot of data to compute aggregation
	- hybrid transaction OLTP + OLAP

# chap 6: memory management
### database control
- spartial
	- where to write on disk
	- keep pages that are used together close as possible on disk
- temporal
	- when reads pages to memory and when writes to disk
	- minimize number of stalls from reading data from disk

### buffer pool
- memory region is array of fixed-size page (frame), when DBMS requests a page, an exact copy of it is placed into one of these frames
- page table keeps track of pages in buffer pool (memory), is protected with latches to ensure thread-safe access
	- latch (mutex) protects critical sections from other threads, is held for operation duration
- page table - page directory
	- page directory: map from page id to disk location
	- page table: map from page id to bufferpool frame

- buffre replacement policies
	- Least-recently used (LRU)
	- clock (approximation of LRU)

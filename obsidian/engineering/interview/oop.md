1. OOP and its 4 principles?
	- is object-oriented programming -> focus on objects and builds things upon them
	- 4 principles
		- encapsulation
			- wraps things into a unity, wraps methods and fields into a class, classes into a package
		- abstraction
			- only care about public fields, attributes, methods, and needn't care about its private stuff and how they are implemented
		- inheritance
			- allow a class to inherit the properties and characteristics from other classes
		- polymorphism
			- uses same types and functions, but their actions depend on its entity (eg. like circle, rectangle, ...)
2. access modifiers?
	- private: can be accessed by things in same class (object?)
	- default: can be accessed in the same package
	- protected: can be accessed in the same package + outside things that have inheritance relationship
	- public: can be accessed by everything
3. interface and abstract class?
	- the difference is the relationship between it and the classes that extend or implement it
	- class A extends abstract class B -> A is B
	- class A implements interface C -> A has C's characteristics

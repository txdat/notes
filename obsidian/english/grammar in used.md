# conditional sentences

- general truths/facts = If + present simple, present simple

- real/possible future = If + present simple, S + will + V_inf

- unreal present/future = If + past simple, S + would + V_inf

- unreal past = If + past perfect, S + would have + V_pp

### wish/hope = S + wish + smb + smt / S + hope + clause

- use `wish` to say that we regret smt, smt is not as we would like it to be
- use `wish + S + had V_pp` to say that we regret smt in the past
# passive

- active verbs -> what subject does?
- passive verbs -> what happens to subject (who/what causes the action may be not important)

# reported speech
- It's said that ...
- Smb told that ...
- It's supposed to ... -> use for what is intended/arranged/expected
	- eg. It is supposed to be a secret (is intended), but everyone seems to know about it

### what changes when converting direct speect to indirect(reported) speech
1. tense backshift
	- main verb is shifted backward (1 tense)
	- when the situation is still the same -> needn't change
	- past perfect (furthest tense in past) doesn't change
2. pronoun change
3. time/place change

### have/get smt done
- arrange smb to do smt for us

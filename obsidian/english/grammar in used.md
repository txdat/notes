# conditional sentences

- general truths/facts = If + present simple, present simple

- real/possible future = If + present simple, S + will + V_inf

- unreal present/future = If + past simple, S + would + V_inf

- unreal past = If + past perfect, S + would have + V_pp

- mixed/reverted/reverse conditional (type 2 + type 3) -> link condition in one time frame to result in another time frame
	- past condition - present result = If + past perfect, S + would + V_inf -> an action/event didn't happen in the past has a lasting effect in the present
		- eg. `If I had studied, I would be a doctor (now)` = `I didn't study in the past, so I'm not a doctor now`
	- present condition - past result = If + past simple, S + would have + V_pp -> a general truth/state that is untrue in the present caused a specific change in the past
		- eg.

### wish/hope = S + wish + smb + smt / S + hope + clause

- use `wish` to say that we regret smt, smt is not as we would like it to be
- use `wish + S + had V_pp` to say that we regret smt in the past

### unless = if not
- is conditional conjunction
- emphasizes a condition that prevents a result
- eg. `If it doesn't rain, we will go out` = `Unless it rains, we will go out`

### if + adj = if S + (be) + adj
- shorten form
- eg. If necessary = If it is necessary, ...
# passive

- active verbs -> what subject does?
- passive verbs -> what happens to subject (who/what causes the action may be not important)

# reported speech
- It's said that ...
- Smb told that ...
- It's supposed to ... -> use for what is intended/arranged/expected
	- eg. It is supposed to be a secret (is intended), but everyone seems to know about it

### what changes when converting direct speect to indirect(reported) speech
1. tense backshift
	- main verb is shifted backward (1 tense)
	- when the situation is still the same -> needn't change
	- past perfect (furthest tense in past) doesn't change
2. pronoun change
3. time/place change

### have/get smt done
- arrange smb to do smt for us

# questions, auxiliary verbs
### questions
- put subject after the first verb
- use negative question to show surprise, expect the listener to agree
- keep the word order when question is a part of longer sentence?
	- eg. Do you know where Tom has gone?

### question tags
- mini question on the end of sentence
- negative question tag after positive sentence, positive question tag after negative sentence
- some verbs with question tag
	- let's ... , shall we?
	- don't ... , will you?
	- I'm ... , aren't you?

### auxiliary verbs
- use aux verbs to not repeat smt, deny/show interest/surprise what smb has said
- use with 'so/neither' (verb before subject)
	- eg. I'm tired -> so am I
	- eg. I never read newspapers -> neither do I

# V-ing (gerunds) / to V
[[V-ing_to-V]]

# prefer / would rather

### prefer (general preference)
- prefer to V
- prefer N/V_ing to N/V_ing -> having comparison

### would prefer (preference in a specific situation)
- would prefer N/to V
- would prefer to V rather than V -> having comparison
- would prefer smb (not) to V

### would rather = would prefer to do
